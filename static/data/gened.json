The world is in the midst of unprecedented social and cultural changes. One important dimension of this global change is the dramatic increase in the consumption of goods manufactured, designed and/or marketed by corporations based mainly in Europe and North America. The consumption of 'northern'goods of all kinds threatens the stability and diversity of the natural environment in many ways. Some also argue that, at the local level, consumption constitutes the greatest contemporary threat to the continued existence of local traditions, local cultures and local economic autonomy. In this course, we will pay special attention to some of the linkages between consumer culture and environmental problems, tracing the chains of cause and effect that connect particular kinds of consumption to specific places, resources, people, and interests. At the end of the course, we will discuss about the anti-consumption, sustainable consumption and other activist strategies for changing the direction of consumer society.", "fulfills": ["Intercultural"]},

Many mythologies include these supernatural characters, and not just modern fiction is full of encounters between normal humans and these human-like creatures. As almost all of these non-human actors are either imaginary or (in the case of aliens, robots, and AIs) highly speculative, one must ask why there is this fascination with beings that are somehow like us, but different, a fascination that stretches over thousands of years. This course explores the rich tradition of non-human beings in literature, art, movies, and computer games, in pursuit of the question what it is to be human.
